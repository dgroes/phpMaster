    <h2>A Beautiful Lie by 30 Seconds to Mars considered a Post Hardcore Album?</h2>
    <p class="descripcion">30STM‚Äôs first three albums‚Äî which I all love to pieces and are some of my favorite albums ever‚Äî are
        primarily progressive rock, but A Beautiful Lie has a LOT of post-hardcore influence and some of the
        songs on it are totally post-hardcore, like ‚ÄúThe Kill‚Äù. They were a prog band but loved to experiment by
        mixing in other rock genres.

        I‚Äôve always thought the self titled album was progressive metal, A Beautiful Lie was prog-pxh and This
        Is War is just prog. Love Lust Faith + Dreams is electronic rock and still listenable while a huge step
        down from the first three and America is hot garbage and the musical equivalent of getting a dead rat or
        used condom in the mail.

    <h2 class="titulo">The manga 20th Century Boys is a masterpiece and one of the best examples of how to perfectly pull off a
        complex story</h2>
    <p class="descripcion">For those who don't know, 20th Century Boys is a manga written by Naoki Urasawa and divided into 250
        chapters. It can be labeled as a thriller, but as it often happens with the best stories, it delves into
        other stuff as well, namely some slight sci-fi and supernatural elements, with even some slice of life
        thrown in.
        The premise is that in 1997 a young man named Kenji discovers the existence of a mysterious conspiracy
        cult that seems to be related to a game he came up with when he was a kid with his friends. The
        conspiracy seems to be responsible for crimes such as disappearances and the release of a dangerous
        virus, and is led by a mysterious figure named "Friend" whose identity is unknown.
        The story however gets really convoluted, since the point of the manga is that it's full of techniques
        such as timeskips, flashbacks and flashforwards, for an overarching plot that spans from 1969 to 2018.
        It also follow the pov of different characters, all of whom are written extremely well.
        Urasawa does a phenomenal job at constantly bombarding the reader with plot points and questions, and at
        the same time answering previously hanging questions. This way the reader can feel a strong sense of
        mystery and confusion (in an engaging way) while at the same time keeping track of what's going on. It's
        a brilliant achievement that many authors fail at, if you ask me.
        The other brilliant thing about 20CB is that everything makes sense at the end. Even some minor plot
        points that the reader might have forgot about are resolved perfectly.
