                Minimalist design emphasizes simplicity and functionality, removing unnecessary elements to focus on what truly matters.
                <br>
                This approach has gained popularity in various fields, including architecture, graphic design, and user interface design.
                <br>
                By using clean lines, ample white space, and a limited color palette, minimalist design creates a sense of clarity and calm.
                <br>
                Many designers believe that minimalism not only enhances aesthetic appeal but also improves user experience.
