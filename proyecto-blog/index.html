            <h2>A Beautiful Lie by 30 Seconds to Mars considered a Post Hardcore Album?</h2>
            <p>30STM’s first three albums— which I all love to pieces and are some of my favorite albums ever— are
                primarily progressive rock, but A Beautiful Lie has a LOT of post-hardcore influence and some of the
                songs on it are totally post-hardcore, like “The Kill”. They were a prog band but loved to experiment by
                mixing in other rock genres.

                I’ve always thought the self titled album was progressive metal, A Beautiful Lie was prog-pxh and This
                Is War is just prog. Love Lust Faith + Dreams is electronic rock and still listenable while a huge step
                down from the first three and America is hot garbage and the musical equivalent of getting a dead rat or
                used condom in the mail.

            <h2>Colma</h2>
            <img src="images/media/colma.png" alt="">
            <p>I like it, too.

                I once read that the album is dedicated to his mother who was batting and eventually recovering from
                colon cancer. With that in mind I can take some more meaning from the music and song titles. In
                particular, in Ghost, in one section, I hear something to the effect of:
                “It’s perfect... I love you... but think about how bad it coulda been...
                Then it repeats
                “Think about how bad it coulda been...” one last time.
                But that’s just what I hear. This section ENDS at 3:30. I’ve tried showing it to people (Buckethead
                fans, even) and most of them just looked at me like I was crazy.
                I like a lot of the songs on the album quite a bit but I’d say Machete is my favorite if I was gonna
                choose just one.
                I have my own inner thoughts on Watching the Boats With My Dad as well but they’re more difficult to put
                into words.

                videos, and more. Post reviews, ramblings, thoughts! You are free to post elsewhere if you wish, but a
